  "content": "# Compute\n\nAzure enables you to deploy and monitor your application code\nrunning inside a Microsoft data center. When you create an application\nand run it on Azure, the code and configuration together is\ncalled an Azure hosted service. Hosted services are easy to\nmanage, scale up and down, reconfigure, and update with new versions of\nyour application's code. This article focuses on the Azure\nhosted service application model.<a id=\"compare\" name=\"compare\"></a>\n\n## Table of Contents<a id=\"_GoBack\" name=\"_GoBack\"></a>\n\n-   [Azure Application Model Benefits][Azure Application Model Benefits]\n-   [Hosted Service Core Concepts][Hosted Service Core Concepts]\n-   [Hosted Service Design Considerations][Hosted Service Design Considerations]\n-   [Designing your Application for Scale][Designing your Application for Scale]\n-   [Hosted Service Definition and Configuration][Hosted Service Definition and Configuration]\n-   [The Service Definition File][The Service Definition File]\n-   [The Service Configuration File][The Service Configuration File]\n-   [Creating and Deploying a Hosted Service][Creating and Deploying a Hosted Service]\n-   [References][References]\n\n## <a id=\"benefits\"> </a>Azure Application Model Benefits\n\nWhen you deploy your application as a hosted service, Azure\ncreates one or more virtual machines (VMs) that contain your\napplication's code, and boots the VMs on physical machines residing in\none of the Azure data centers. As client requests to your hosted\napplication enter the data center, a load balancer distributes these\nrequests equally to the VMs. While your application is hosted in \nAzure, it gets three key benefits:\n\n-   **High availability.** High availability means Azure ensures\n    that your application is running as much as possible and is able to\n    respond to client requests. If your application terminates (due to\n    an unhandled exception, for example), then Azure will detect\n    this, and it will automatically re-start your application. If the\n    machine your application is running on experiences some kind of\n    hardware failure, then Azure will also detect this and\n    automatically create a new VM on another working physical machine\n    and run your code from there. NOTE: In order for your application to\n    get Microsoft's Service Level Agreement of 99.95% available, you\n    must have at least two VMs running your application code. This\n    allows one VM to process client requests while Azure moves\n    your code from a failed VM to a new, good VM.\n\n-   **Scalability.** Azure lets you easily and dynamically\n    change the number of VMs running your application code to handle the\n    actual load being placed on your application. This allows you to\n    adjust your application to the workload that your customers are\n    placing on it while paying only for the VMs you need when you need\n    them. When you want to change the number of VMs, Azure\n    responds within minutes making it possible to dynamically change the\n    number of VMs running as often as desired.\n\n-   **Manageability.** Because Azure is a Platform as a Service\n    (PaaS) offering, it manages the infrastructure (the hardware itself,\n    electricity, and networking) required to keep these machines\n    running. Azure also manages the platform, ensuring an\n    up-to-date operating system with all the correct patches and\n    security updates, as well as component updates such as the .NET\n    Framework and Internet Information Server. Because all the VMs are\n    running Windows Server 2008, Azure provides additional\n    features such as diagnostic monitoring, remote desktop support,\n    firewalls, and certificate store configuration. All these features\n    are provided at no extra cost. In fact, when you run your\n    application in Azure, the Windows Server 2008 operating\n    system (OS) license is included. Since all of the VMs are running\n    Windows Server 2008, any code that runs on Windows Server 2008 works\n    just fine when running in Azure.\n\n## <a id=\"concepts\"> </a>Hosted Service Core Concepts\n\nWhen your application is deployed as a hosted service in Azure,\nit runs as one or more *roles.* A *role* simply refers to application\nfiles and configuration. You can define one or more roles for your\napplication, each with its own set of application files and\nconfiguration. For each role in your application, you can specify the\nnumber of VMs, or *role instances*, to run. The figure below show two\nsimple examples of an application modeled as a hosted service using\nroles and role instances.\n\n##### Figure 1: A single role with three instances (VMs) running in an Azure data center\n\n![image][0]\n\n##### Figure 2: Two roles, each with two instances (VMs), running in an Azure data center\n\n![image][1]\n\nRole instances typically process Internet client requests entering the\ndata center through what is called an *input endpoint*. A single role\ncan have 0 or more input endpoints. Each endpoint indicates a protocol\n(HTTP, HTTPS, or TCP) and a port. It is common to configure a role to\nhave two input endpoints: HTTP listening on port 80 and HTTPS listening\non port 443. The figure below shows an example of two different roles\nwith different input endpoints directing client requests to them.\n\n![image][2]\n\nWhen you create a hosted service in Azure, it is assigned a\npublicly addressable IP address that clients can use to access it. Upon\ncreating the hosted service you must also select a URL prefix that is\nmapped to that IP address. This prefix must be unique as you are\nessentially reserving the *prefix*.chinacloudapp.cn URL so that no one else\ncan have it. Clients communicate with your role instances by using the\nURL. Usually, you will not distribute or publish the Azure\n*prefix*.chinacloudapp.cn URL. Instead, you will purchase a DNS name from\nyour DNS registrar of choice and configure your DNS name to redirect\nclient requests to the Azure URL. For more details, see\n[Configuring a Custom Domain Name in Azure][Configuring a Custom Domain Name in Azure].\n\n## <a id=\"considerations\"> </a>Hosted Service Design Considerations\n\nWhen designing an application to run in a cloud environment, there are\nseveral considerations to think about such as latency,\nhigh-availability, and scalability.\n\nDeciding where to locate your application code is an important\nconsideration when running a hosted service in Azure. It is\ncommon to deploy your application to data centers that are closest to\nyour clients to reduce latency and get the best performance possible.\nHowever, you might choose a data center closer to your company or closer\nto your data if you have some jurisdictional or legal concerns about\nyour data and where it resides. There are six data centers around the\nglobe capable of hosting your application code. The table below shows\nthe available locations:\n\n<table border=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"border: 2px solid #000000;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 100px;\">\n**Country/Region**\n\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 200px;\">\n**Sub-regions**\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\nChina\n\n</td>\n<td>\nEast & North\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\nWhen creating a hosted service, you select a sub-region indicating the\nlocation in which you want your code to execute.\n\nTo achieve high availability and scalability, it is critically important\nthat your application's data be kept in a central repository accessible\nto multiple role instances. To help with this, Azure offers\nseveral storage options such as blobs, tables, and SQL 数据库. Please see\nthe [Data Storage Offerings in Azure][Data Storage Offerings in Azure] article for more\ninformation about these storage technologies. The figure below shows how\nthe load balancer inside the Azure data center distributes\nclient requests to different role instances all of which have access to\nthe same data storage.\n\n![image][3]\n\nUsually, you want to locate your application code and your data in the\nsame data center as this allows for low latency (better performance)\nwhen your application code accesses the data. In addition, you are not\ncharged for bandwidth when data is moved around within the same data\ncenter.\n\n## <a id=\"scale\"> </a>Designing your Application for Scale\n\nSometimes, you may want to take a single application (like a simple web\nsite) and have it hosted in Azure. But frequently, your\napplication may consist of several roles that all work together. For\nexample, in the figure below, there are two instances of the Web Site\nrole, three instances of the Order Processing role, and one instance of\nthe Report Generator role. These roles are all working together and the\ncode for all of them can be packaged together and deployed as a single\nunit up to Azure.\n\n![image][4]\n\nThe main reason to split an application into different roles each\nrunning on its own set of role instances (that is, VMs) is to scale the\nroles independently. For example, during the holiday season, many\ncustomers may be purchasing products from your company, so you might\nwant to increase the number of role instances running your Web Site role\nas well as the number of role instances running your Order Processing\nrole. After the holiday season, you may get a lot of products returned,\nso you may still need a lot of Web Site instances but fewer Order\nProcessing instances. During the rest of the year, you may only need a\nfew Web Site and Order Processing instances. Throughout all of this, you\nmay need only one Report Generator instance. The flexibility of\nrole-based deployments in Azure enables you to easily adapt your\napplication to your business needs.\n\nIt's common to have the role instances within your hosted service\ncommunicate with each other. For example, the web site role accepts a\ncustomer's order but then it offloads the order processing to the Order\nProcessing role instances. The best way to pass work form one set of\nrole instances to another set of instances is using the queuing\ntechnology provided by Azure, either the Queue Service or\nService Bus Queues. The use of a queue is a critical part of the story\nhere. The queue allows the hosted service to scale its roles\nindependently allowing you to balance the workload against cost. If the\nnumber of messages in the queue increases over time, then you can scale\nup the number of Order Processing role instances. If the number of\nmessages in the queue decreases over time, then you can scale down the\nnumber of Order Processing role instances. This way, you are only paying\nfor the instances required to handle the actual workload.\n\nThe queue also provides reliability. When scaling down the number of\nOrder Processing role instances, Azure decides which instances\nto terminate. It may decide to terminate an instance that is in the\nmiddle of processing a queue message. However, because the message\nprocessing does not complete successfully, the message becomes visible\nagain to another Order Processing role instance that picks it up and\nprocesses it. Because of queue message visibility, messages are\nguaranteed to eventually get processed. The queue also acts as a load\nbalancer by effectively distributing its messages to any and all role\ninstances that request messages from it.\n\nFor the Web Site role instances, you can monitor the traffic coming into\nthem and decide to scale the number of them up or down as well. The\nqueue allows you to scale the number of Web Site role instances\nindependently of the Order Processing role instances. This is very\npowerful and gives you a lot of flexibility. Of course, if your\napplication consists of additional roles, you could add additional\nqueues as the conduit to communicate between them in order to leverage\nthe same scaling and cost benefits.\n\n## <a id=\"defandcfg\"> </a>Hosted Service Definition and Configuration\n\nDeploying a hosted service to Azure requires you to also have a\nservice definition file and a service configuration file. Both of these\nfiles are XML files, and they allow you to declaratively specify\ndeployment options for your hosted service. The service definition file\ndescribes all of the roles that make up your hosted service and how they\ncommunicate. The service configuration file describes the number of\ninstances for each role and settings used to configure each role\ninstance.\n\n## <a id=\"def\"> </a>The Service Definition File\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, the service definition (CSDEF) file is an XML\nfile that describes the various roles that make up your complete\napplication. The complete schema for the XML file can be found here:\n[http://msdn.microsoft.com/zh-cn/library/azure/ee758711.aspx][http://msdn.microsoft.com/zh-cn/library/azure/ee758711.aspx].\nThe CSDEF file contains a WebRole or WorkerRole element for each role\nthat you want in your application. Deploying a role as a web role (using\nthe WebRole element) means that the code will run on a role instance\ncontaining Windows Server 2008 and Internet Information Server (IIS).\nDeploying a role as a worker role (using the WorkerRole element) means\nthat the role instance will have Windows Server 2008 on it (IIS will not\nbe installed).\n\nYou can certainly create and deploy a worker role that uses some other\nmechanism to listen for incoming web requests (for example, your code\ncould create and use a .NET HttpListener). Since the role instances are\nall running Windows Server 2008, your code can perform any operations\nthat are normally available to an application running on Windows Server\n2008.\n\nFor each role, you indicate the desired VM size that instances of that\nrole should use. The table below shows the various VM sizes available\ntoday and the attributes of each:\n\n<table border=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"border: 2px solid #000000;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr align=\"left\" valign=\"top\">\n<td>\n**VM Size**\n\n</td>\n<td>\n**CPU**\n\n</td>\n<td>\n**RAM**\n\n</td>\n<td>\n**Disk**\n\n</td>\n<td>\n**Peak  \nNetwork I/O**\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr align=\"left\" valign=\"top\">\n<td>\n**Extra Small**\n\n</td>\n<td>\n1 x 1.0 GHz\n\n</td>\n<td>\n768 MB\n\n</td>\n<td>\n20GB\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\\~5 Mbps\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr align=\"left\" valign=\"top\">\n<td>\n**Small**\n\n</td>\n<td>\n1 x 1.6 GHz\n\n</td>\n<td>\n1.75 GB\n\n</td>\n<td>\n225GB\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\\~100 Mbps\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr align=\"left\" valign=\"top\">\n<td>\n**Medium**\n\n</td>\n<td>\n2 x 1.6 GHz\n\n</td>\n<td>\n3.5 GB\n\n</td>\n<td>\n490GB\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\\~200 Mbps\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr align=\"left\" valign=\"top\">\n<td>\n**Large**\n\n</td>\n<td>\n4 x 1.6 GHz\n\n</td>\n<td>\n7 GB\n\n</td>\n<td>\n1TB\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\\~400 Mbps\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr align=\"left\" valign=\"top\">\n<td>\n**Extra Large**\n\n</td>\n<td>\n8 x 1.6 GHz\n\n</td>\n<td>\n14 GB\n\n</td>\n<td>\n2TB\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\\~800 Mbps\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\nYou are charged hourly for each VM you use as a role instance and you\nare also charged for any data that your role instances send outside the\ndata center. You are not charged for data entering the data center. For\nmore information, see [Azure Pricing][Azure Pricing]. In general, it is\nadvisable to use many small role instances as opposed to a few large\ninstances so that your application is more resilient to failure. After\nall, the fewer role instances you have, the more disastrous a failure in\none of them is to your overall application. Also, as mentioned before,\nyou must deploy at least two instances for each role in order to get the\n99.95% service level agreement Microsoft provides.\n\nThe service definition (CSDEF) file is also where you would specify many\nattributes about each role in your application. Here are some of the\nmore useful items available to you:\n\n-   **Certificates**. You use certificates for encrypting data or if\n    your web service supports SSL. Any certificates need to be uploaded\n    to Azure. For more information, see [Managing Certificates\n    in Azure][Managing Certificates\n    in Azure]. This XML setting installs previously-uploaded\n    certificates into the role instance's certificate store so that they\n    are usable by your application code.\n\n-   **Configuration Setting Names**. For values that you want your\n    application(s) to read while running on a role instance. The actual\n    value of the configuration settings is set in the service\n    configuration (CSCFG) file which can be updated at any time without\n    requiring you to redeploy your code. In fact, you can code your\n    applications in such a way to detect the changed configuration\n    values without incurring any downtime.\n\n-   **Input Endpoints**. Here you specify any HTTP, HTTPS, or TCP\n    endpoints (with ports) that you want to expose to the outside world\n    via your *prefix*.chinacloadapp.cn URL. When Azure deploys your\n    role, it will configure the firewall on the role instance\n    automatically.\n\n-   **Internal Endpoints**. Here you specify any HTTP or TCP endpoints\n    that you want exposed to other role instances that are deployed as\n    part of your application. Internal endpoints allow all the role\n    instances within your application to talk to each other but are not\n    accessible to any role instances that are outside your application.\n\n-   **Import Modules**. These optionally install useful components on\n    your role instances. Components exist for diagnostic monitoring,\n    remote desktop, and Azure Connect (which allows your role\n    instance to access on-premises resources through a secure channel).\n\n-   **Local Storage**. This allocates a subdirectory on the role\n    instance for your application to use. It is described in more detail\n    in the [Data Storage Offerings in Azure][Data Storage Offerings in Azure] article.\n\n-   **Startup Tasks**. Startup tasks give you a way to install\n    prerequisite components on a role instance as it boots up. The tasks\n    can run elevated as an administrator if required.\n\n## <a id=\"cfg\"> </a>The Service Configuration File\n\nThe service configuration (CSCFG) file is an XML file that describes\nsettings that can be changed without redeploying your application. The\ncomplete schema for the XML file can be found here:\n[http://msdn.microsoft.com/zh-cn/library/azure/ee758710.aspx][http://msdn.microsoft.com/zh-cn/library/azure/ee758710.aspx].\nThe CSCFG file contains a Role element for each role in your\napplication. Here are some of the items you can specify in the CSCFG\nfile:\n\n-   **OS Version**. This attribute allows you to select the operating\n    system (OS) version you want used for all the role instances running\n    your application code. This OS is known as the *guest OS*, and each\n    new version includes the latest security patches and updates\n    available at the time the guest OS is released. If you set the\n    osVersion attribute value to \"\\*\", then Azure automatically\n    updates the guest OS on each of your role instances as new guest OS\n    versions become available. However, you can opt out of automatic\n    updates by selecting a specific guest OS version. For example,\n    setting the osVersion attribute to a value of\n    \"WA-GUEST-OS-2.8\\_201109-01\" causes all your role instances to get\n    what is described on this web page:\n    [http://msdn.microsoft.com/zh-cn/library/hh560567.aspx][http://msdn.microsoft.com/zh-cn/library/hh560567.aspx]. For more\n    information about guest OS versions, see [Managing Upgrades to the\n    Azure Guests OS].\n\n-   **Instances**. This element's value indicates the number of role\n    instances you want provisioned running the code for a particular\n    role. Since you can upload a new CSCFG file to Azure\n    (without redeploying your application), it is trivially simple to\n    change the value for this element and upload a new CSCFG file to\n    dynamically increase or decrease the number of role instances\n    running your application code. This allows you to easily scale your\n    application up or down to meet actual workload demands while also\n    controlling how much you are charged for running the role instances.\n\n-   **Configuration Setting Values**. This element indicates values for\n    settings (as defined in the CSDEF file). Your role can read these\n    values while it is running. These configuration settings values are\n    typically used for connection strings to SQL 数据库 or to \n    Azure Storage, but they can be used for any purpose you desire.\n\n## <a id=\"hostedservices\"> </a>Creating and Deploying a Hosted Service\n\nCreating a hosted service requires that you first go to the [Azure Management Portal] and provision a hosted service by specifying\na DNS prefix and the data center you ultimately want your code running\nin. Then in your development environment, you create your service\ndefinition (CSDEF) file, build your application code and package (zip)\nall these files into a service package (CSPKG) file. You must also\nprepare your service configuration (CSCFG) file. To deploy your role,\nyou upload the CSPKG and CSCFG files with the Azure Service\nManagement API. Once deployed, Azure, will provision role\ninstances in the data center (based upon the configuration data),\nextract your application code from the package, copy it to the role\ninstances, and boot the instances. Now, your code is up and running.\n\nThe figure below shows the CSPKG and CSCFG files you create on your\ndevelopment computer. The CSPKG file contains the CSDEF file and the\ncode for two roles. After uploading the CSPKG and CSCFG files with the\nAzure Service Management API, Azure creates the role\ninstances in the data center. In this example, the CSCFG file indicated\nthat Azure should create three instances of role \\#1 and two\ninstances of Role \\#2.\n\n![image][5]\n\nFor more information about deploying, upgrading, and reconfiguring your\nroles, see the [Deploying and Updating Azure Applications][Deploying and Updating Azure Applications]\narticle.<a id=\"Ref\" name=\"Ref\"></a>\n\n## <a id=\"references\"> </a>References\n\n-   [Creating a Hosted Service for Azure][Creating a Hosted Service for Azure]\n\n-   [Managing Hosted Services in Azure][Managing Hosted Services in Azure]\n\n-   [Migrating Applications to Azure][Migrating Applications to Azure]\n\n-   [Configuring an Azure Application][Configuring an Azure Application]\n\n<div style=\"width: 700px; border-top: solid; margin-top: 5px; padding-top: 5px; border-top-width: 1px;\">\n\n<p>Written by Jeffrey Richter (Wintellect)</p>\n\n</div>\n\n  [Azure Application Model Benefits]: #benefits\n  [Hosted Service Core Concepts]: #concepts\n  [Hosted Service Design Considerations]: #considerations\n  [Designing your Application for Scale]: #scale\n  [Hosted Service Definition and Configuration]: #defandcfg\n  [The Service Definition File]: #def\n  [The Service Configuration File]: #cfg\n  [Creating and Deploying a Hosted Service]: #hostedservices\n  [References]: #references\n  [0]: ./media/application-model/application-model-3.jpg\n  [1]: ./media/application-model/application-model-4.jpg\n  [2]: ./media/application-model/application-model-5.jpg\n  [Configuring a Custom Domain Name in Azure]: http://windowsazure.cn/zh-cn/documentation/articles/cloud-services-custom-domain-name/\n  [Data Storage Offerings in Azure]: /develop/net/how-to-guides/blob-storage-v17/\n  [3]: ./media/application-model/application-model-6.jpg\n  [4]: ./media/application-model/application-model-7.jpg\n  \n  [Azure Pricing]: /zh-cn/pricing/overview/\n  [http://msdn.microsoft.com/zh-cn/library/azure/ee758710.aspx]: http://msdn.microsoft.com/zh-cn/library/azure/ee758710.aspx\n  [http://msdn.microsoft.com/zh-cn/library/hh560567.aspx]: http://msdn.microsoft.com/zh-cn/library/hh560567.aspx\n  [Azure Management Portal]: http://manage.windowsazure.cn/\n  [5]: ./media/application-model/application-model-8.jpg\n  [Deploying and Updating Azure Applications]: /develop/net/fundamentals/deploying-applications/\n  [Creating a Hosted Service for Azure]: http://msdn.microsoft.com/zh-cn/library/gg432967.aspx\n  [Managing Hosted Services in Azure]: http://msdn.microsoft.com/zh-cn/library/gg433038.aspx\n  [Migrating Applications to Azure]: http://msdn.microsoft.com/zh-cn/library/gg186051.aspx\n  [Configuring an Azure Application]: http://msdn.microsoft.com/zh-cn/library/azure/ee405486.aspx\n"
