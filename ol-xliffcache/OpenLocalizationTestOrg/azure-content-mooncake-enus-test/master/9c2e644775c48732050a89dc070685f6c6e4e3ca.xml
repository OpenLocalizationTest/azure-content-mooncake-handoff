This article explains how to use connection pooling or persistent connections to more effectively access MySQL Database on Azure.\n\n## Access databases that use connection pooling (recommended)##\nAs MySQL Database on Azure performs more authentication tasks when it establishes connections, the result can be connections that require even greater overhead than the local database. Managing database connections can have a significant impact on the performance of the application as a whole. To optimize the performance of your program, the goals should be to reduce the number of times connections are established and to avoid putting the time for establishing connections in key code paths. We strongly recommend that you use database connection pooling or persistent connections to connect to MySQL Database on Azure. Database connection pooling handles the creation, management, and allocation of database connections. When a program requests a database connection, it prioritizes the allocation of existing idle database connections, rather than the creation of a new connection. Once the program has finished using the database connection, the connection is recovered in preparation for further use, rather than simply being closed down.\n\nThis article explains this further by providing a [piece of sample code that uses Java as an example](http://wacnstorage.blob.core.chinacloudapi.cn/marketing-resource/documents/MySQLConnectionPool.java) for your reference.
